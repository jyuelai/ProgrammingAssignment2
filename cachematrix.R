## Matrix inversion is usally a costly computation.
## The following functions are able to cache the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by the previous function.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then this function should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data,...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m    
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
